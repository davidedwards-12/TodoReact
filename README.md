# TodoReact README

Simple todo website that uses Django and React

To run the website:
 - Have two terminals open, one for on the backend and one for the frontend.
 - In the backend terminal, navigate to the backend folder (cd todo-react/backend).
 - In the frontend terminal, navigate to the front folder (cd todo-react/frontend).
 - In the backend terminal, you have to start a virtual environment by running "pipenv shell".
 - Then, you can run "python manage.py runserver" to start up the backend server.
 - In the frontend terminal, run "npm start"
 - Once you run "npm start", then the website will start up!
